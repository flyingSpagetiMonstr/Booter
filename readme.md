This is a final project of my assembly language course which I took during my freshman year.

the main functions:
- RESET PC
- START SYSTEM
- CLOCK
  - Esc: go back
  - F1: change color
- SET CLOCK

Recently I am having a course of OS experiment, which again also has win x86 as the platform, so I am reviewing my code and found that the CLOCK function doesn't work anymore so currently I am debugging and initialized this repo.

The debugging is done
